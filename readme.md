This is a Nodemcu-based LED scrolling display system using md_parola library.

The program demonstrates the use of the scrolling function to display text received from the app. As shown on the app scfreenshot, a user can type their custom message and send it so that the display will start scrolling it. 

In order to set up this system, the following libraries must be configured in the arduino ide prior to loading this code into the ESP

<MD_Parola.h>

<MD_MAX72xx.h>

Help can be found online to get that done.

After uploading the code into Nodemcu (ESP12) and powered on, turn on the wifi of your mobile phone or pc as the case maybe. You are likely to see a wifi with the name 'AkoredeAP', connect to it and its password is 'ak12345'. 
Load your browsing and type this in the address bar: 192.168.4.1

The circuit image was gotten from "Great Projects" from "arduino-projects-free.blogspot.com" for the circuit.

Thanks.
